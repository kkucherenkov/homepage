# About

With almost 20 years of experience as a software engineer, I have successfully engaged in the entire life-cycle of development, encompassing comprehensive tasks such as analysis, design, development, deployment, testing, implementation, and maintenance of application software across diverse platforms, including mobile, backend, and desktop.  

Throughout the past three years, my focus has primarily been on backend development, sharpening my expertise in languages such as Golang and TypeScript for Node.js. However, I have also maintained my mobile development knowledge, actively applying it to personal projects. This dynamic has fueled my aspiration to transition into a full-stack role, leveraging both my backend and mobile development skills to contribute to the entire spectrum of software development.  

These competencies enable me to effectively navigate fast-paced and challenging environments, consistently delivering results even under pressure.  

Overall, my extensive experience, diverse skill set, and ability to thrive in demanding situations make me a valuable asset to any software development team. I am eager to apply my expertise and contribute to the success of future projects.
